        "\nSimulation of sound degradation due to geometric, atmospheric and habitat attenuation\n=====================================================================================\n\nWhen sound travels in air (or in water), initial acoustic signature may change \nregarding distances due to attenuation. Sound attenuation in natural environment \nis very complex to model. We propose to reduce the complexity by decomposing \nthe sound attenuation to three main sources of attenuation : \n- the geometric attenuation (Ageo) also known as spreading loss or geometric \ndispersion, \n- the atmospheric attenuation (Aatm) \n- and the habitat attenuation (Ahab). The later encompasses several sources of \nattenuation and might be seen as a proxy.\n"

        "When working with sound attenuation in real environment, it is essential to\nknow the sound pressure level at a certain distance (generally 1m). Here\nwe used spinetail sound. We assume that its sound level @1m = 85dB SPL.\nIt is also essential to be able to tranform the signal recorded by the\nrecorder into sound pressure level. Here, the audio recorder is a SM4 \n(Wildlife Acoustics) which is an autonomous recording unit (ARU) from\nWildlife. The sensitivity of the internal microphone is -35dBV and the \nmaximal voltage converted by the analog to digital convertor (ADC) is 2Vpp \n(peak to peak). The gain used for the recording is a combination of\nthe internal pre-amplifier of the SM4, which is 26dB and the adjustable gain\nwhich was 16dB. So the total gain applied to the signal is : 42dB\n\n"
