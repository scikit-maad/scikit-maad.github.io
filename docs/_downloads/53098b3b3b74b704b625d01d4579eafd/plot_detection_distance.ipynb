        "\n# Detection distance estimation \n\nWhen sound travels in air (or in water), initial acoustic signature may change \nregarding distances due to attenuation. Sound attenuation in natural environment \nis very complex to model. We propose to reduce the complexity by decomposing \nthe sound attenuation to three main sources of attenuation : \n- the geometric attenuation (Ageo) also known as spreading loss or geometric \ndispersion, \n- the atmospheric attenuation (Aatm) \n- and the habitat attenuation (Ahab). The later encompasses several sources of \nattenuation and might be seen as a proxy.\n\nKnowing the attenuation law and the sound level at each frequency, it is \npossible to estimate the detection distance of each frequency component of \nthat sound\n\nIn this example, we will estimate the detection distance of each frequency\ncomponent of a sound that travels in rainforest at noon, when the ambient\nsound level is the lowest. \n"
